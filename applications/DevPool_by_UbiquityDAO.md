## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).

DevPool is a crypto-native platform that organically sits on top of GitHub to optimally match developers with open tasks and get paid in crypto while automating the administrative components for DAOs and Repo managers.

- A brief description of your project.

DevPool is our tested in-house solution to efficiently buildup and run natively decentralized organizations (such as ours- Ubiquity DAO). The DevPool platform utilizes our in-house algorithm and AI which is integrated right into Github in order to optimize productivity and development flow. DevPool helps build infrastructure faster and better by incentivizing the right people at the right time to build by way of optimal job matching and financial rewards.
DevPool mechanics encourage decentralized development and improve developers' collaboration and community building.
The DevPool roadmap is quite extensive. The purpose of this grant is to accelerate specific components thereof as outlined below.
The scope of this grant is to further functional development of DevPool in order to provide a superlative experience on GitHub for projects and developers. 

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

DevPool is true our name and is uniquely situated as a project-agnostic product. As such it is ubiquitous to all projects that utilize GitHub for their development. DevPool has the ability to touch and improve all projects.

DevPool accelerates Open Source development and encourages building for all ecosystems. Including Polkadot, Substrate & Kusama.

From the standpoint of the projects that are being developed on Polkadot, Substrate & Kusama, DevPool helps deliver faster development while doing so more efficiently with its contribute-to-earn productivity model and established developers' collaboration flows.

For developers, DevPool is the optimal freelance platform and at the same time the ability to solve interesting technical issues.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

We believe our project will succeed because it is a necessary utility for all distributed teams and projects. 
We are creating a self-sustaining and self-growing infrastructure that helps build, enrich, and enhance the ecosystem and its participants with contribute-to-earn opportunities facilitated by Ubiquity DevPool.

DevPool was born from our existing needs to optimally develop our DAO. With in-house use, we proved the model based on the need and are able to give the right work to the right developers and in doing so optimize both the DAOs time to market as well as each individual developer’s strong points and preferences. 

Both of these optimization points lead to a faster turnaround of a superior end product. Releasing DevPool to the public will create a huge marketplace full of opportunities for developers to earn more and become more involved in projects that interest them while allowing projects to be built faster by applying the optimal talent at the right time.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components

- Demo: [https://dao.ubq.fi/the-devpool](https://dao.ubq.fi/the-devpool)
- Website: [https://ubq.fi/](https://ubq.fi/)
- Twitter: [https://twitter.com/UbiquityDAO](https://twitter.com/UbiquityDAO)
- Discord/Discourse/Community: [https://t.me/ubiquitydao](https://t.me/ubiquitydao)
- Github: [https://github.com/ubiquity](https://github.com/ubiquity)
- Technical/Economic Documentation: 
[https://github.com/ubiquity/bounty-bot/discussions/1](https://github.com/ubiquity/bounty-bot/discussions/1)
[https://dao.ubq.fi/devpool](http://dao.ubq.fi/devpool)
- Other: [https://t.me/UbiquityDevPool](https://t.me/UbiquityDevPool)

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

The system uses only data available on GitHub.
UbiquiBot uses information about the priority and the planned duration of the issue.
In addition, the address of the bounty hunter is required for payment.

- An overview of the technology stack to be used

The system is fully integrated into GitHub and implemented as a GitHub application available in the marketplace [https://github.com/marketplace/ubiquibot](https://github.com/marketplace/ubiquibot) 

UbiquiBot is developed with TypeScript, Supabase, Vercel, GitHub Actions, Probot
[https://github.com/ubiquity/bounty-bot](https://github.com/ubiquity/bounty-bot)

The only smart contract we use in the system at this time is [Uniswap’s Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2). It has received audits from [ABDK](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/main/audits/ABDKAudit.pdf) and [Chainsecurity](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/main/audits/Chainsecurity%20Audit.pdf).

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

Documentation on the DevPool capabilities overview and roadmap discussion https://github.com/ubiquity/bounty-bot/discussions/1


- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

Beta version is functioning in the active Ubiquity GitHub repositories and can be added to any other GitHub repository easily by adding our bot to your repository https://github.com/marketplace/ubiquibot

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

Since Ubiquity aims to create a project-agnostic experience, we do not need to narrow the project scope to specific ecosystems while excluding others. We are building a seamless platform that meshes into GitHub. As such every project that utilizes GitHub benefits from DevPool 

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

DevPool was born from our existing needs to optimally develop our DAO. With in-house use, we proved the model based on the need and are able to give the right work to the right developers and in doing so optimize both the DAOs time to market as well as each individual developer’s strong points and preferences. 

Both of these optimization points lead to a faster turnaround of a superior end product. Releasing DevPool to the GitHub ecosystem will create immense efficiencies for all marketplace participants within all ecosystems and projects. Developers will earn more and become more involved in projects that interest them. Projects will be built faster by applying the optimal talent at the right time. Managers will have efficient tools and reports into their project’s progress allowing them to optimize their time and resources in a way that was never available up until now.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience is Builders, Repo Managers and all projects that are collaborated on GitHub. 
As well as the developers that help bring these ideas and visions into reality.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

DevPool is our tested in-house solution to efficiently buildup, run, and scale natively decentralized organizations (such as ours). The DevPool platform utilizes our in-house algorithm and AI which is integrated right into Github in order to optimize productivity and development flow. DevPool helps build infrastructure faster and better by incentivizing the right people at the right time to build by way of optimal job matching and financial rewards.
DevPool mechanics encourage decentralized development and improve developers' collaboration and community building.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

We have a first-mover advantage as there is no competitor deploying our model with organic GitHub integration.

There are many freelance platforms for developers, but none of them are leveraging:
1. Available natively on GitHub
2. Focused on crypto bounties Team 
3. Crypto native organic community affinity

### DevPool smart automations get more done in less time

Welcome to DevPool, a Ubiquity Research Ltd. product. Brought to you by Ubiquity DAO.

DevPool is Ubiquity’s solution to help get projects done faster and more efficiently. 
DevPool is built by developers, for developers. DevPool is the crypto native platform that is organically meshed into GitHub to get your projects done faster, cheaper and better while helping developers get more work!

DevPool allows you to: 

1. Speed up project completion times.
2. Setup open tasks and assign them a deadline and payment ( We call that a Bounty).
3. Match the right people for the right job. Developers see your Bounty and take it on. 
One developer per task. Since DevPool is on Github, you can see prior contributions before accepting the developer. 

DevPool fast, secure and easy to use. As a project manager, you only pay when you approve work.

You can add bonus pay to develop complicated or sticky tasks. The right bounty hunter will get it done for you courtesy of DevPool.

Easy to use and easy to manage:

1. DevPool lets you see all your Bounty projects and track their progress. 
2. Pay automatically in crypto (alongside bonus Ubiquity Dollar incentives).

Increase your developing capacity without increasing your overhead. 

Here is a quick video to showcase the simplicity and power of the DevPool:

Automation and highlights that are suitable both for bounty issuers and bounty hunters:

- Automatic bounty price setting based on the issue characteristics.
- Bounty-developer matchmaking and auto-inviting relevant developers to take on the bounty via GitHub.
- Command line control via GitHub comments includes assigning the bounty and providing the wallet.
- Smart notifications and automatic reminders via GitHub comments.
- Auto-payment is whereby the bounty hunter gets paid once a bounty is accepted.
- Automatic payment which reduces overhead for the bounty issuer as it does not require performing manual payment
- Auto-reporting after bounty payment is complete.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

Offline:
Ubiquity DAO team members are very active around the world at various hackathons, builder events, VC communities and many web3 events. In the past few months we have attended all the main events in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and upcoming events in Singapore and Bali. We are constantly building relationships with new projects as well as incumbents all across the space. 

We have been receiving press coverage in professional magazines and anticipate more such coverage as time progresses.

Online:
We have built the Ubiquity DAO telegram group to over 12,000 members and an active DevPool ecosphere on both GitHub and Telegram even though we are prelaunch. We feel the excitement around our project and are looking forward to its steady and ever increasing growth. 

Our members are very closely aligned with Crypto Twitter, developers, projects and founding individuals. 

We believe we are well situated to be a solid utility success story for the web3 community and would like the Web3 Foundation to officially be part of our journey.

Research 

We are constantly looking for interesting and useful approaches to implement the DevPool mission to enrich life on GitHub.

The team conducted a series of research on the needs of developers and projects on GitHub and also described the necessary functions of DevPool.

From the Open Source projects standpoint, we are exploring automation, gamification, and AI to improve the management of developers in the Web3 era.

For the developers, we are creating a convenient mechanism for receiving bounties, participation in interesting GitHub projects, and professional development.

Currently, we are looking for partners interested in the long-term stable growth of the DevPool.

Development

The team has already explored a few approaches and created several prototypes.
The best things have formed the basis of the MVP that is already functioning.
The MVP implements a number of features that have already proved their effectiveness for Ubiquity.

More details can be found in the DevPool documentation and demo.
